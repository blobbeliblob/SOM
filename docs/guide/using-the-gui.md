## Preparation

The SOM graphical user interface can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/helcomsecretariat/SOM/releases), and only requires the Python dependencies to be installed (step 1 and 3 in [Installation](installation.md)). Once downloaded, extract the compressed file into a chosen directory.

## Running the tool

The tool can be executed by running the ```SOM.exe``` app. For explanations on the parameter options presented, see [Configuration](configuration.md).

## Results

The results matrices are saved to the excel file set in ```config.toml```. The individual simulation round results are saved to the ```sim_res``` folder. Plots are saved to the ```output``` folder.
